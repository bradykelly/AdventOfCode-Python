# Advent Of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles, with 1 two-part puzzle unlocked every day in the 25 days leading up to Christmas.
This repo is the source code of my attempts to solve these puzzles in Python, a language I am still learning.

Please note that in all likelyhood these source files represent very bad and ineffcient ways of solving the puzzles.
